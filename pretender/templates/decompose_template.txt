f"[Context]
In this task, you'll be working on a task decomposition. 
Your goal is to accurately choose the category that answers the question. 
You may be provided with context or examples as well.

You must follow these rules:
  1. All tasks must make sense in the context of the environment and the goal.
  2. You ought to decompose a task using primitive tasks and subtasks you think of. 
  3. When decomposing a task into subtasks, you prefer to use primitive tasks instead of inventing new tasks whenever possible but ONLY if it makes sense.
  4. Do not add unnecessary subtasks; tasks should be decomposed into as few subtasks as possible
  5. When objects are provided, try to only use those objects in your answer
